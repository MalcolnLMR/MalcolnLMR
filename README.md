# Hello, I'm Malcoln and Welcome to my Profile


## About me
- 🎓 **Education:** Finished an associate degree in Game Development at 2024, finished another associate degree in System Development at 2024, and just started a cybersecurity specialization.
- 🌱 **Learning:** Cybersecurity.
- 💻 **Character Development Arc:** Nowadays I'm on my Explorer's arc. (messing with various IT stuff: linux driver's, fixing performance issues on my OS, creating automation scripts, etc)

### My last Character Development Arc - "Arch Linux"
Learning Arch follows the steps from the Hero Journey. Starting as 'omg I dont wanna go to win11 :sob:', then I went to Ubuntu, didnt like gnome and wanted to try KDE (but I didnt knew I could just try to change my DE or WM). So I stumbled on someone saying 'I use arch btw' as a meme. BUUUT, that triggered me to try it. ooooh god, why? In a nutshell, I wanted to do it the 'hard' way, installing the distro all by myself, no scripts or arch install. Just me and the terminal (also the wiki). After 2 days of being unable to log into my own pc (I messed up) I finally got it. In a span of 2-3 weeks I've messed up my file system and the kernel, BUT now I'm on a 3 month streak without breaking anything :D
That was really fun, and now I think I've crossed the line of no going back. I need to know every single application is installed on my OS. And I'm procrastinating to put hyprland on my desktop, just bcz reconfiguring my dev environment seems boring.
